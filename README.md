# Marker-based Interactive Business Card

This project aims to create a marker-based interactive business card using the Unity engine. The business card will incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology to provide an engaging and immersive experience for users.

# Features

- Augmented reality: The business card will utilize marker-based AR technology to overlay virtual content onto the physical card.
- Marker detection: The app will recognize specific markers on the business card, triggering the display of interactive virtual content.
- Interactive elements: Users will be able to interact with the virtual content, such as tapping buttons, swiping, or performing gestures.
- Personalized information: The business card will include relevant contact information and professional details, enhancing the traditional business card experience.
